# Case Study: Bellabeat Wellness Technology Analysis (Google Data Analytics Capstone)

## Introduction

This project analyzes the Bellabeat Wellness Technology Case Study, a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I will address key business questions using the six-step data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

## Background

Founded in 2013 by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, Bellabeat is a high-tech company that specializes in manufacturing health-focused products designed to interact with one another for women. Bellabeat's products collect data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health, empowering women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since its inception, Bellabeat has quickly grown into a leading tech-driven wellness company for women. By 2016, Bellabeat had expanded its operations, opening offices worldwide and launching multiple products available on its company website and through various online retailers.

Bellabeat offers a vast array of products, including the Bellabeat app which provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. Their product line also features the Leaf, a versatile wellness tracker that can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip; the Time, a wellness watch combining classic aesthetics with smart technology to track activity, sleep, and stress; and finally, the Spring, a smart water bottle that tracks daily water intake. These smart technology options can all connect, enabling data-driven insights. In addition, Bellabeat provides a subscription-based membership program offering 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness, tailored to individual lifestyles and goals.

## Scenario

In this hypothetical case study I am working as a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat and will be presenting my findings as well as possible solutions to the Bellabeat executive team. My report will specifically entail a clear statement on the business task, a description of data used, documentation of cleaning or manipulation of data, a summary of analysis, supporting visualizations and my top recommendations based on the analysis.

## Step 1: Ask

The business task is to analyze Bellabeat's data to understand how consumer usage patterns differ among active and inactive users. By identifying key trends in usage, I will provide data-driven recommendations to the Bellabeat executive team on how to optimize marketing strategies to increase user engagement and drive business growth.

## Step 2: Prepare

### Data Integrity Check (ROCCC)

To ensure the validity of my analysis, I will evaluate the provided dataset against the ROCCC framework to verify that the data is reliable, original, comprehensive, current, and cited.

The data for this project is a public dataset from Kaggle, specifically from the Mobius user profile, which was generated by responses to a survey conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. It contains personal health data from 30 consensual Fitbit users, including daily activity, steps, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

To evaluate the data's suitability, I applied the ROCCC framework. The data's reliability is a concern due to the small sample size, which is insufficient to accurately reflect the broader population of female Fitbit users. Its originality is also limited as it was collected by a third party. Furthermore, the dataset is not comprehensive since it lacks key demographic information like age and gender, and it is not current, with responses collected from March to May 2016. However, the data is a strong point, as it is well-cited and documented, which provides a level of trustworthiness. Despite these limitations, the data contains enough relevant health information to address the business questions. After this initial assessment, I prepared the data for analysis in RStudio."

### Preparing RStudio

To start the analysis, the following packages—tidyverse (for data manipulation and visualization), janitor (for cleaning), and lubridate (for date formatting)—were installed and activated in R. Four separate raw data files were then imported as data frames.

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("janitor")
install.packages("lubridate")

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor) 
library(lubridate)

daily_activity <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
daily_sleep <- read_csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
hourly_steps <- read_csv("hourlySteps_merged.csv")
hourly_calories <- read_csv("hourlyCalories_merged.csv")
```

## Step 3: Process

### Data Cleaning 

The four raw datasets were cleaned to ensure consistency for merging. This included standardizing column names (to snake_case), removing duplicates, converting the user ID column to a character format for joining, standardizing date/time fields, and removing unecessary columns (distance and sleep records).

```r
daily_activity_clean <- daily_activity %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(id = as.character(id)) %>%
  rename(date = activity_date) %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>%
  select(-tracker_distance, -logged_activities_distance, -sedentary_active_distance)

daily_sleep_clean <- daily_sleep %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(id = as.character(id)) %>%
  rename(date = sleep_day) %>%
  mutate(date = as_date(mdy_hms(date))) %>%
  select(-total_sleep_records)

hourly_steps_clean <- hourly_steps %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(id = as.character(id)) %>%
  mutate(
    activity_hour = mdy_hms(activity_hour),
    hour = hour(activity_hour) 
  )

hourly_calories_clean <- hourly_calories %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(id = as.character(id)) %>%
  mutate(
    activity_hour = mdy_hms(activity_hour),
    hour = hour(activity_hour)
  )
```

### Data Merging

The cleaned daily and hourly datasets are combined into two comprehensive tables using an R full_join().

```r
daily_combined <- full_join(
  daily_activity_clean,
  daily_sleep_clean,
  by = c("id", "date")
)

hourly_combined <- full_join(
  hourly_steps_clean,
  hourly_calories_clean,
  by = c("id", "activity_hour", "hour")
)
```

### Adding Columns

A day of week column was thena added to both combined datasets. 

```r
daily_combined <- daily_combined %>%
  mutate(
    day_of_week = lubridate::wday(date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
  )

hourly_combined <- hourly_combined %>%
  mutate(
    day_of_week = lubridate::wday(activity_hour, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
  )
```

A total active minutes column to only the daily combined dataset.

```r
daily_combined <- daily_combined %>%
  mutate(
    total_active_minutes = very_active_minutes + fairly_active_minutes + lightly_active_minutes
  )
```

## Step 4: Analyze

### Graphing Average Steps by Day of Week

```r
daily_combined %>%
  group_by(day_of_week) %>%

  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Steps by Day of the Week",
    x = "Day of the Week",
    y = "Average Steps"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Graphing Average Steps by Hour of Day

```r
hourly_combined %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarise(average_steps = mean(step_total, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = average_steps)) +

  labs(
    title = "Average Steps by Hour of the Day",
    x = "Hour of the Day (0-23)",
