# Case Study: Bellabeat Wellness Technology Analysis (Google Data Analytics Capstone)

## Introduction

This project analyzes the Bellabeat Wellness Technology Case Study, a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I will address key business questions using the six-step data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

## Background

Bellabeat is a high-tech company founded in 2013 that manufactures health-focused products for women. The company collects data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health to empower women with knowledge about their health and habits.

Bellabeat's product line includes:
-Bellabeat App: Provides health data on activity, sleep, stress, and more.
-Leaf: A versatile wellness tracker worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip.
-Time: A wellness watch combining classic aesthetics with smart tracking.
-Spring: A smart water bottle that tracks daily water intake.
-Subscription Program: Offers personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, etc.

These smart products are designed to interact with one another to provide data-driven insights.

## Scenario

In this hypothetical case study I am working as a junior data analyst  on the marketing team at Bellabeat and will be presenting my findings as well as possible solutions to the Bellabeat executive team. My report will specifically entail a clear statement on the business task, a description of data used, documentation of cleaning or manipulation of data, a summary of analysis, supporting visualizations and my top recommendations based on the analysis.

## Step 1: Ask

The business task is to analyze Bellabeat's data to gain insight on how consumer use non-Bellabeat smart devices by analyzing FitBit data. By identifying key trends in usage, I will provide data-driven recommendations to the Bellabeat executive team on how to optimize marketing strategies for their devices to increase user engagement and drive business growth.

## Step 2: Prepare

### Data Integrity Check (ROCCC)

To ensure the validity of my analysis, I will evaluate the provided dataset against the ROCCC framework to verify that the data is reliable, original, comprehensive, current, and cited.

The data for this project is a public dataset from Kaggle, specifically from the Mobius user profile, which was generated by responses to a survey conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. It contains personal health data from 30 consensual Fitbit users, including daily activity, steps, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

Applying the ROCCC framework:

-Reliable: Low due to only 33 disitnct users being a small sample size. 
-Original: Low due the data being provided from a third party data provider (Amazon Mechanical Turk).
-Comprehensive: Low due to the data only contianing infromation about activity and not containing information about gender age and health conditons. 
-Current: Low due to the data being from 9 years ago.
-Cited: Low due to the fact that it has been obtained from an unidentified third partyu source (Amazon Mechanical Turk).

### Preparing RStudio

To start the analysis, the following packagesâ€”tidyverse (for data manipulation and visualization), janitor (for cleaning), and lubridate (for date formatting) were installed and activated in R. Four separate raw data files were then imported as data frames.

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("janitor")
install.packages("lubridate")

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor) 
library(lubridate)

daily_activity <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
daily_sleep <- read_csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
hourly_steps <- read_csv("hourlySteps_merged.csv")
hourly_calories <- read_csv("hourlyCalories_merged.csv")
```

## Step 3: Process

### Data Cleaning 

The four raw datasets were cleaned to ensure consistency for merging. This included standardizing column names (to snake_case), removing duplicates, converting the user ID column to a character format for joining, standardizing date/time fields, and removing unecessary columns (distance and sleep records).

```r
daily_activity_clean <- daily_activity %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(id = as.character(id)) %>%
  rename(date = activity_date) %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>%
  select(-tracker_distance, -logged_activities_distance, -sedentary_active_distance)

daily_sleep_clean <- daily_sleep %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(id = as.character(id)) %>%
  rename(date = sleep_day) %>%
  mutate(date = as_date(mdy_hms(date))) %>%
  select(-total_sleep_records)

hourly_steps_clean <- hourly_steps %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(id = as.character(id)) %>%
  mutate(
    activity_hour = mdy_hms(activity_hour),
    hour = hour(activity_hour) 
  )

hourly_calories_clean <- hourly_calories %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(id = as.character(id)) %>%
  mutate(
    activity_hour = mdy_hms(activity_hour),
    hour = hour(activity_hour)
  )
```

### Data Merging

The cleaned daily and hourly datasets were combined into two comprehensive tables using an R full_join().

```r
daily_combined <- full_join(
  daily_activity_clean,
  daily_sleep_clean,
  by = c("id", "date")
)

hourly_combined <- full_join(
  hourly_steps_clean,
  hourly_calories_clean,
  by = c("id", "activity_hour", "hour")
)
```

### Adding Columns

A day of week column was then added to both combined datasets. 

```r
daily_combined <- daily_combined %>%
  mutate(
    day_of_week = lubridate::wday(date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
  )

hourly_combined <- hourly_combined %>%
  mutate(
    day_of_week = lubridate::wday(activity_hour, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
  )
```

A total active minutes column to only the daily combined dataset.

```r
daily_combined <- daily_combined %>%
  mutate(
    total_active_minutes = very_active_minutes + fairly_active_minutes + lightly_active_minutes
  )
```

## Step 4: Analyze

### Graphing Average Steps by Day of Week

```r
daily_combined %>%
  group_by(day_of_week) %>%
  summarise(average_steps = mean(total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = average_steps)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Steps by Day of the Week",
    x = "Day of the Week",
    y = "Average Steps"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Graphing Average Steps by Hour of Day

```r
hourly_combined %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarise(average_steps = mean(step_total, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
